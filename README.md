Outlined in the PDF is an open framework for organizing agental cohorts against a broad range of task-centric applications. The framework scales well across various organizational sizes. It is dynamic enough as to allow its components to fit their environment with an appreciable degree of freedom. This would indicate that it should scale well across geographic distances. 

The framework is intended to be populated by both ML learners (intelligence-on-silicon), as well as by biological human learners (intelligence-on-carbon). Because of this we will be opening with a brief section on the optimization of training for the human learner. 
After this, we’ll talk about The Protégé Method, the three phase training method of WATCH. DO. TEACH. 

Then finally, we’ll talk about the structure of the framework itself, with special emphasis on its method of distilling information down its layers, as well as how it reacts to novel situations.
